To run the software, simply open the JamSS.jar file or, to run in an eclipse project,
run the Jam.java class.

Usage instructions:

Step 1 - Select the input. This works best as an instrument or microphone plugged into a mic port on the computer.

Step 2 - Choose the settings for the session:
		- The tempo slider controls the speed of the accompaniment.
		- The root note and scale dropdowns determine the notes played by the 		accompaniment.
		- The drum file selects the .midi file to be used as a drum sequence.
		- The sound dropdown changes the midi sound of the Lead instrument.
		- The JAM! button begins play of the accompaniment.
		
Note: Settings can be changed mid-session.

Step 3 - Play! The accompaniment will change to follow the notes you play. If you do not have an instrument available, whistling works as the best alternative.
The spectrogram gives a visual representation of the note you are playing and its frequency in Hz.
